          Advait is a rising junior studying in Raha International School Abu Dhabi, UAE. He always had a passion to create a 
          large scale impact on the lives of orphans after he conducted a research project on intergenerational occupation 
          mobility under a Professor from New York University AD. Statistically, he saw the drastic differences that exist 
          between underprivileged and privileged areas around the world.  Advait aims to tackle this unequal distribution of 
          resources through Defy in the lives of orphans. Additionally, he is a published author, ranked chess player, national 
          actor, Economic researcher and a cricket player. In his free time, he enjoys watching thriller movies and series on Netflix.
